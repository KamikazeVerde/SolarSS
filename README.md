### ScreenShare Helper | Python | ImGui
- How does it works?
  You just put it into Suspect's PC and start the program!
### ChangeLog 0.8
- Added Linux Test Compatibility for X11 and WayLand
- Fixed .exe conversion, error due to missing GLFW binaries
---------------------------------------------------------
### Someone called the release a "rat" so, here is how to compile .py to .exe
- Do pip install auto-py-to-exe
- Now find these 2 dlls in ur python installation: glfw3.dll and msvcr110.dll
- Now in auto-py-to-exe just add as binaries glfw3.dll and msvcr110.dll
- Now set console and one file and compile!
